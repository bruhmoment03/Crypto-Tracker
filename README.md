## What's this?
Covid-Tracker written in C# `(known as C++++)` for finals, The code has been written as simplified as possible to make sure my partner Wegar can understand the code completely, I'll keep updating the project if I have time, or rewrite / change the whole project.

## How does it work?
First of all, when you open the program, a function I made will loop through all the avaliable crypto in **coingecko**, and then add it to the ComboBox for crypto selection.
After that, you can simplify select the crypto you want to search and then click the Button on the left side of the ComboBox, the result will appear in the GridView as soon as we received the response from **coingecko API**.

`(Better explanations are commented in the code.)`
